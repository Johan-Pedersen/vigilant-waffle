This is my binary calculator.
It uses 2's complement to calculate negativ numbers.

Notes for using it:
-Input to the program is binary numbers.
-The length of 1 input should at least be as long as the result.
-It uses a signbit to describe positiv and negativ numbers. So a "0" in front means positiv and a "1" in front means negativ.
-Therefore the length of a input is at least 2 and also if you want to write the equivalent of decimal "0", you should enter "00" 
(+zero).
